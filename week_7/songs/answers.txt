If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I would create a predetermined list of audio auras that have ranges for all of the describing fields in this song database.
Then you could easily query the db to get the overall average values of these fields and assign them to an aura.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

It might only represent a small subset of a users actual aura and the averages would be heavily skewed by outliers.
I would do this better by doing an aura survey and using neural network ai to categorize users to fit the results of the survey.
